369,hi hello,"@IVaV Cheers for the compliment. What youâ€™re attempting to describe is the Laffer curve, which doesnâ€™t state that tax cuts predictably increase revenue as youâ€™ve mischaracterised, but rather that a balanced tax rate which is neither too high nor low is needed for optimal government revenue. Not to mention the fact that the skew of the curve varies depending on the particular economic conditions of the country being analysed, which in turn affects what tax rate is optimal. <br><br>Itâ€™s general consensus amongst economistsâ€™ estimations of the UK laffer curve that the benefits of tax cuts to government revenue arenâ€™t likely to be observed until tax rates surpass 75%. Given our current tax rates, higher taxes are undoubtedly needed to increase revenues, let alone under Trussâ€™ plan to cut taxes further.",,,1,,,1

396,John Tumpkin,"The new British PM has started on a strong footing.  Energy affordability intervention by Government is always a good move,  both to ameliorate  expenditure burdens of the populace,  and to maintain a grip on clean energy.  If people are overwhelmed by energy bills,  it is much more difficult to keep focused on clean,  environmentally friendly energy sources, for the preservation of the Earth, its inhabitants and its resources.   Support for charities mentioned elsewhere is a humane move,  assisting to counterbalance perceived stringency of Conservative and Unionist Party financial policies.  Added to this, support for NPOs, including churches and other religious organizations,  and NGOs also assists to put a human face on the broader economy, together with self-employment,  freelancing,  and an up to standard informal sector of the economy.  Unfortunately,  large salaries will not solve the problems of humankind,  because the more people have,  the more they spend and borrow.  What will assist to transform the economy from a self-seeking jungle of grossly unequal salaries for equal human beings,  with equal needs and rights,  will be equal human living amounts for all, albeit with unequal allowances,  perks and privileges relating to education,  qualification, position,  seniority,  and the like.   That is a significantly better jungle than one in which massive inequalities are all called salary.   Those aspects of life that generally do not fit conveniently into personal income,  such as education,  housing and mobility,  can be provided based upon rung by rung success, and tax contributions.   In this regard,  reducing the ordinary person&#39;s tax burdens is always a good idea.  Suppose the British Government would like to reduce taxes by 20%, it could instead reduce taxes by 18-15%, for example, and utilize the extra 2-5% on education,  medical services,  etcetera,  which would assist the majority of persons more effectively,  these not being sufficiently empowered in these areas by the Tax reductions alone.   Heavy taxes the world over are symptomatic of hypermilitarism of societies  - and also of the continuing attempts of the financially disempowered majority to guarantee a workable share of the pie, particularly in areas such as state education and medical institution (hospitals,  clinics,  etcetera) provisions!   No political party is perfect,  and the  number of leaders over a time span need not be held against those in power.   A cricket team in which each player scores upward of 20 or 30 runs, on average, can win just as well as a cricket team comprised of a few &quot;centurions&quot; and mostly weaker batters,  according to the conditions being faced on the pitch.   God bless Liz Truss and her &quot;cabinet&quot; as they rise to the occasion,  in order that inflation may subside through sensible,  sensitive economic measures!  God bless Great Britain, her Majesty the Queen,  and her Majesty&#39;s Government!  God bless planet Earth,  somewhere upon which I continue to dwell!",1,,,,,0

To start with, in order to find the substance that was given to Lilibet&#39;s grandmother, you need to find those who created the play in Salisbury. After all, the substance that it was given from the same laboratory in the UK. You will no longer be able to interrogate Lisey, because she is a member of the government, and she only indirectly participated there and can only pass as a witness, although she can help find other participants in the conspiracy. But here is the former boss, a crazy cyclist, here he got up to his elbows, by the way, there are conspirators and in MI6 check those who were related to environmentalists and cooperate with the United States. And also check the health of William (I donâ€™t know how they are going to remove him for him) and George was given a drug that affects the brain and can cause a decrease in development in the future. The point is - some people who have great power in the United States, and in Britain, need to change power on the throne until 2024, until the elections in the United States are held. To do this, you need to get rid of your grandmother and imprison Uncle Charles (because they have a lot of compromising evidence on him), then restore Harry to the throne, and after the elimination of the nearest contenders, Harry will sit on the throne and Meghan will lead the country, who was specially thrown into Harry&#39;s bed.

486,John Pearson,"Romans 3:23 states: &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;. We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. <br><br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",,1,,,,0

Non of what he wants to promise can be achieved before the term of parliament is over. I could understand it more if an election was coming in next few months, but not for a government that is now 3 years old and more than halfway through but still not ending for at least another year.
