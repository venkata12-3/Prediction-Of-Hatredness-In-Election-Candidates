The Only Truth from this unelected, overprivileged PM as been his admission that he doesn&#39;t know or have any friends among  Workers! - He&#39;s so &#39;grateful; to NHS workers he wants to &#39;reward&#39; them with a 2% payrise - in effect another Cut. He is, himself, cushioned from the People&#39;s experience of the cost of living crisis, not least by his wife&#39;s ?œfortune - but calls the deportation of vulnerable people risking their lives crossing the English Channel in leaky boats seeking Refuge increasingly from the effects of places rendered unlivable due to climate change - he endorses deportation to Rwanda, sub-Saharan Africa where the population has suffered most from a climate catastrophe that they did not cause.",1,,,,,0

After watching these 2 Speeches I learned that Starmer had first of all nothing to offer, for instead of Starmer to go there with the 5 pledges his Labour party would deliver to the nation if Labour wins, he just went there and started criticizing the 5 pledges that the PM announced already on the 4 th of January yet Starmer was meant to have his own 5 pledges. Starmer did not offer anything to the nation., where as Sunak he had his 5 pledges he planned and he presented them on his new year speech and he was honest as well. Starmer presented himself on this new year speech like he is in a parliament where he faces the PM and accuse what the government has already planned. Starmer lost on New year speech for he proved he is out of touch, no charisma, idealistic, is not fit to lead a country.",1,,,,,0
